##Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for the Ready-Made Garments Obsernations application

#Questions:

    1. Are there any serious disadvantages from having the output of a task be a single dictionary that contains
       all observations?

    2. Will it be possible to store the outtput files in a dropbox folder?

    3. Is it better to build one application that does multiple tasks, or should tasks be separate? There is no
       real need for this application to be uploaded to the AppStore as I can personally load the code into
       Pythonista on the iPads that will be used by the observers (the teams are very small)

    4. Is there a more interesting interface that could be used? The console is fine, but its a bit uninspiring.
       Ideally after configuration the application would create a button for each operator which maps to some
       idea of the pysical reality of their location on the floor, and then when undertaking tasks the user would
       simply touch the button to initialise the prompts for information. This is especially the case for the
       interaction task (see readMe) 

    5. Whilst I do not want to allow the user to 'cancel' dialogue boxes (as they return KeyboardInterrupt) which
       will cause the program to crash, and I do not want them to be capable of being pressed by accident, I do
       want the user to be able to escape a task (and lose all accumulated data), if a task is entered accidentally.
       Is this achievable?

    6. I do not currently understand the main(argv) function, so I have left it blank for now and tried to write the
       routine in linear format I guess. What does the function do? Does it assist if the ipad 'home' button is
       pressed accidentally? This is something I will need to consider. I do not want to lose information as the
       user accidentally pressed the home button. I will try to brush up on what is going on here.
