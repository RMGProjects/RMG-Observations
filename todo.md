1. Remove the attendance component of the WIP task as this will be determined by the id_dict routine

2. Add a component to the WIP that allows the id_dict to be modified if a change in the mc_status has occurred since undertaking the id_dict routine (see RMG_wip.md for details)

3. Add a level of detail to the WIP dict that asks the user to enter state whether the operator is working on the body or the collar, and if body then to input wip for each panel (see RMG_wip.md for details)
