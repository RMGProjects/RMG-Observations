# Ready-Made Garments Backend Strategy

## A backend process will need to gather new observations, integrate them with previous observations, store, backup, and report on observations

###Gather New Observations
Observations will be posted to Dropbox by Observers on a periodic basis.

###Integrate with New Observations into Previous Observations

###Store Observations
Will observations be stored in a SQL database?

###Backup Obesrvations
Timestamped versions of the Observation database will be copied to Dropbox

###Report on Observations
Who needs to see Observation reports and in what format?
